Intro:
Ryan - NI
Matt - NI
David - Rally

The retrospective is currently a very disparate process. Teams that use Rally as
their "single source of truth" rely on other tools, sticky notes, or memory
to track one of the most critical Agile ceremonies. Our team at NI uses a custom external app
whose output is often discarded, forgotten, or never acted on.

Our app brings this collaboration into Rally by allowing users to add feedback,
collaborate with others on the team, and facilitate the retrospective discussion in a single source.

As soon as the Iteration is created in Rally, the retrospective is available. Users
can open the app and add feedback immediately rather than waiting days or weeks to capture their feedback. 
Users have visibility into others' ideas, and they can like the ideas to promote them for the meeting.

The team is empowered to delete items or mark items as discussed that are duplicated to streamline the discussion
in the retrospective meeting.

Here's how our team retrospected this year's hackathon. We brainstormed ideas in the app, and we were able to like ideas
that we agreed with, and start our discussion.


Problem:
- Physically stored (On stickies, not searchable, hard to track over time)
- Feedback collected in meeting after event has passed

The App:
We're going to create an app to facilitate the Retrospective discussion, allowing users to submit and collaborate points of feedback in the moment
It will collect team feedback (what went well, what should stop, ideas, kudos)
It will allow voting and provide a way to generate action items which spawn from the discussion.

** intro
This is what I will say during the intro. I will also review the following tasks supported by our app:
* joining a retro
* adding a new item - anonymous
* liking/unliking an existing item
* deleting an item
* completing an item

** joining a retro
Here's why you'd do that
* Not everyone brainstorms effectively on-the-spot and people forget their feedback by the time the retro begins. We provide users the ability to log, collaborate and management feedback as soon as the Iteration is created.
* People tend to focus on the last three or four days, a significantly shorter period than the average iteration.
* Once the retro is complete, it becomes difficult to review previously discussed retro actions. All feedback points, likes, and status is managed in Rally, which enables a single source of truth.


** adding a new item
To add a new item enter some text in the description field. We'll add "UX helped a lot with our design, thanks Adrienne and Alex!". Now select a category, from good, bad, ideas, and acclaim this seems like acclaim.
You might want to post these anonymously becuase you don't feel safe, but you have the option to attach your name to ideas. When you're done, just click add.

** like and delete
The app enables a streamlined process that allows users to collaborate and groom items in a way that facilitates conversation
